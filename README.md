# Deprecation notice

The **Lightning-SDK blueprint** has been deprecated with the release of [Lightning SDK v2](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/Lightning-SDK)

Please follow the steps in the [Getting Started Guide](https://webplatformforembedded.github.io/Lightning-SDK/#/getting-started/getting-started) of the Lightning-SDK, to create a new Lightning App blueprint using the [Lightning-CLI](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/Lightning-CLI)

If you still want to create an App using the "previous" SDK, please checkout the [`previous` branch](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/Lightning-SDK-blueprint/tree/previous) and follow the instructions there.
